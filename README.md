# Homework 4: Dafny

## Due date: Tuesday, May 28

## Getting started

You will need to have Dafny installed.

- If you are on Mac, see [Homework 0](https://github.com/DavisPL-Teaching/189c-hw0) for instructions:
```
brew install dotnet
brew install dafny
```
Then, in VSCode, install the Dafny extension -- link here:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dafny-lang.ide-vscode

- If you are on Windows or Linux: TODO

As with the previous homeworks, you will submit your homework through GitHub Classroom. Please see [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/lt90i40zrot3ue/post/48) for further instructions.

## Checking that installation worked

To double check, run `dafny --version`, you should get something like:
```
4.6.0
```

## Assignment

Similar to HW1 and HW2, there are three parts to this assignment.
- Part 1 is a series of mini exercises.
- Part 2 TODO
- Part 3 TODO

To continue, open and edit the files `part1.dfy`, `part2.dfy`, and `part3.dfy`.
